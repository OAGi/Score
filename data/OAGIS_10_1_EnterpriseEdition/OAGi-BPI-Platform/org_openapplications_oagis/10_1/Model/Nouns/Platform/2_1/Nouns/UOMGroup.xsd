Note that these conditions further require the first alternate UOM occurrence to always be expressed in terms relative to the stocking UOM.  This declaration methodology permits applications to construct a linked UOM conversion hierarchy and calculate a conversion factor between any given alternate and stocking UOM.

The Multiplier Specifies both the quantity and UOM which are equivalent to the alternate Unit-of-Measure.   The value of the MultiplierQuantity compound may be any whole or fractional numeric value.  The UOM field within the MultiplierQuantity compound must contain either one of the following values:
