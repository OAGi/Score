			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">The purpose of the ChangeAcknowledgeRequireProduct is to enable a business application such as Order Management to reserve a quantity of goods or services for a specific date and time. The business process scenario is the Order Management application interacting with the Available to Promise or Production application in order to determine availability of a product for the customer.

This scenario is commonly referred to as Make to Order or Build to Order.
The ChangeAcknowledgeRequireProduct accomplishes this task in a two step process within this one request:
1.  First the receiving business application checks to see if an item is available in sufficient quantity by a specific date and time.
2.  The receiving business application then reserves that quantity of inventory for that specific date and time combination if the product is available.
If the product requested is not available, 

The responding application may send one of two responses:
1.  A ConfirmBOD to confirm the denial of the request.
2.  A ShowProductAvailability  to communicate an alternative product availability.  This may be OrderItem, Date, or Quantity, or a combination of these.  This may also be accompanied with a message in the Note field Identifier stating that this is an alternative.

If the product requested is available:
The responding application may send a ConfirmBOD to confirm the execution of the request.

This BOD will likely cause ChangeAcknowledges to occur.

This BOD may be used individually, or as part of a larger interface scenario.  The GetProductAvailability and ShowProductAvailability may be used before an ChangeAcknowledgeRequireProduct, but they are not required. </xsd:documentation>
