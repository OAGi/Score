			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">In an effort to simpilify the usage of the verbs the CancelAcknowledgeCostingActivity BOD is being deprecated as of OAGIS 9.0, the CancelAcknowledgeCostingActivity will still be provided for the next three releases at which time it is scheduled to be removed from OAGIS.  As such for all new development we recommend that you use the PostCostingActivity BOD which may serve the same function of the CancelAcknowledgeCostingActivity BOD.

The purpose of the CancelAcknowledgeCostingActivity BOD is to enable the update of Activityinformation from a production or manufacturing application to a costing application.  This is necessary for applications that are based on a Dual Cycle Accounting model.  This Dual Cycle Accounting model does not capture the details of the Activities that caused entries to be made in the general ledger application, but instead captures them in a separate overall costing application.
This BOD commonly causes updates to occur and may be used as part of a large integration scenario or as a single tool for updating data. 

For Single Cycle accounting systems, the PostJournalEntry BOD will be used to ensure that the costing information flows from the Manufacturing Application to the Financial Application.

In most cases either PostJournal or CancelAcknowledgeActivity will be used when the Financial applications are included with Logistics, but both Business Service Requests will not be used in the same integration scenario.</xsd:documentation>
