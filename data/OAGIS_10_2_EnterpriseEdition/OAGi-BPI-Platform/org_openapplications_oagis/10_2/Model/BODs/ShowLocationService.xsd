This BOD may be initiated by the sending system upon some event occurring, such as receiving a request submitted by another system for certain location service.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, the customer management, the supplier management, or HRMS business applications could use this to receive processed location information from location service providers.</xsd:documentation>
