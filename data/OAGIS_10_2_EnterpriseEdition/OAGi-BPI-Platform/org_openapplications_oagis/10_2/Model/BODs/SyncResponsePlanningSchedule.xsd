			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">Since collaboration between a customer and a supplier can potentially go through several rounds of negotiations, both parties can use the same BOD to communicate their current demand or supply schedule in response to what they received from the other party.  Either party can indicate detailed exception descriptions along with reason code and action code to the other party why the original demand/supply requirements need to be adjusted using the optional component PlanningScheduleException
.
The purpose of the SyncResponsePlanningSchedule is to communicate requirement information (part number, quantity, etc.) between a customer and their supplier on a regular basis, for example daily, weekly etc, or for a user-defined time bucket type definition (Component FexibileBucket) that is sent as part of this PlanningSchedule.  

SyncResponsePlanningSchedule allows the adding of new requirements and the modification of previously established requirements.  

Customers can use this PlanningSchedule to communicate demand requirement in three different ways.  It can be as specific as the Item level or at the Commodity code level, which is higher than item.  Furthermore, it can be required simply by functional specification via feature identifiers and values using the optional component FeatureValue.</xsd:documentation>
