paths may be too long otherwise.
	
As with all OAGIS releases OAGIS Release 10_2 contains XML Schema. To view 
XML Schema it is recommended that you use an XML IDE, as the complete structure 
of the Business Object Documents are not viewable from a single file.

Note that the sample files were used to verify the XMLSchema 
development, and do not necessarily reflect actual business 
transactions.  In many cases,the data entered in the XML files are just 
placeholder text.  Real-world examples for each transaction will be 
provided as they become available. If you are interested in providing 
real-world examples please contact oagis@openapplications.org

Please send suggestions or bug reports to oagis@openapplications.org

Thank you for your interest and support.

The Open Applications Group Architecture Council
