                        <xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">The ShowReceiveDelivery may be used to obtain information about a specific expected (unreceived) or previously received goods delivery.   The ShowReceiveDelivery may be issued in response to a GetReceiveDelivery request, or emitted asynchronously for notification upon some business event.

For expected deliveries, the ShowReceiveDelivery document content may act as a receiving template or checklist to identify the quantity and shipping configuration of the expected goods.  In this manner the ShowReceiveDelivery may be considered logically equivalent to the Advance Ship Notice information in a ShowShipment document.   This similarity is by design, as the receiver's ShowReceiveDelivery may be directly derived from shipper's ShowShipment content after the receiver's business logic has appropriately validated the Advance Ship Notification information.

The ShowReceiveDelivery supports describing shipment content at either the line item level and/or the ship unit level.  Intermediate transportation/logistics providers or freight forwarding partners can use this document to acknowledge the receipt of entire shipping units without detailing the corresponding contents.</xsd:documentation>
