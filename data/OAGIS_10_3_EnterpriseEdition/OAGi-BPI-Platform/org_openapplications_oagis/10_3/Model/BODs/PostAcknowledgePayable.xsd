			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">The purpose of the PostAcknowledgePayable is to transmit data to create a payable open item in a payables application from the purchasing information generated in a purchasing application.  The PostAcknowledgePayable may also update the General Ledger, depending on the specific architecture of the financial applications.

The scope of the PostAcknowledgePayable indicates that the supplier's invoice is ready to be paid and has already been approved before the information moves to the accounts payable application.  An approved invoice is also known as the voucher.  OAGIS will define the scenario of invoices that get matched within the accounts payable application in a separate Business Service Request later.

Some financial applications have the general ledger and accounts payable databases tightly integrated where updates to the accounts payable application are automatically reflected in the general ledger balances.
</xsd:documentation>
			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">The PostAcknowledgePayable will transmit all information needed for both the accounts payable and the general ledger.

Other applications allow the general ledger balances to be updated separately from the accounts payable.  The second model illustrates that the combination of the PostAcknowledgePayable and PostJournalEntry will accomplish this scenario.
