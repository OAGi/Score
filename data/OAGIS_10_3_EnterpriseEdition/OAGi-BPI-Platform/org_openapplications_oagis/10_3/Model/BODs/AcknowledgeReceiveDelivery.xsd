The acknowledgement may contain the full detail of the receipt as created by the receiving party or just the discrepancies and other exception conditions.

The AcknowledgeReceiveDelivery BOD supports receipt acknowledgements at either the line item level and/or the ship unit level.  Intermediate transportation/logistics providers or freight forwarding partners can use this document to acknowledge the receipt of entire shipping units without detailing the corresponding contents.</xsd:documentation>
