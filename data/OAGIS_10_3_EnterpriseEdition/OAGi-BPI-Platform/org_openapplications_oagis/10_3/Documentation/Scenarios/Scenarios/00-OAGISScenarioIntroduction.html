The
OAGIS Scenarios included within depict sample integration scenarios
that the content of the Open Applications Group Integration
Specification (OAGIS) supports. <br>
      <br>
These scenarios are intended to be used
as models for designing one's own solutions based on the content
offered by
OAGIS. They are not meant to be Standards as such and they are not
meant to be
used only as illustrated. These scenarios are also not meant to be
machine
executable today but they are designed to lead to the development of
such capabilities in the
future.<br>

example Scenarios as is and you may modify them with attribution for
the
specific needs of your organization and your integration requirements.<br>

Our volunteer, member staffed Working Groups who

documents as is practical. If you

Scenarios or the use of them, please
