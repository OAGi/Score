      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
44 - Supply
Chain Execution</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">44.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #44
describes integration of order management
and receiving systems with external supplier systems and warehouse
management application. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <br>
The order management system is shown as
managing the interface with the external supplier partner. The order
management system communicates to the warehouse management delivery system. <br>
      <br>
The warehouse management system informs the receiving system
what to expect in a delivery. Once received, the receiving system
updates the order management system on what was received and
acknowledges the delivery to the external supplier partner. </span> <br>

Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.<br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">44.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
      <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment for this
integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.
      <br>
      </span><br>

      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">44.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
contains four major application: the external supplier partner,
material scheduling or order management, warehouse management systems,
and the receiving system. <b><br>
      <br>
Note:</b> The order management, warehouse management and receiving
systems could
be part of a single or possible within different ERP systems. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their
interrelationships.&nbsp; <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></span><br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">44.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
This scenario
has the following major events in the workflow sequence. <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">PlanningSchedule</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">ShipmentSchedule,
and <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">SequenceSchedule
created and agreed to by the external supplier
order system and the internal order management systems. <br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Once these
are
agreed to and the supplier has either acquired or manufactured the
item(s) Additional steps not addressed in this scenario, but are
described in earlier scenarios include:</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
Ship the goods - once the shipment has been
loaded on the transportation mechanism a shipment detail is provided
to the order management system.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
next step is for the order management system to communicate the
delivery information to the warehouse management system so that shelf
space or and available inventory can be noted.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
The next step is for the warehouse management system to communicate
to the receiving system what to expect on the delivery. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
next step is for the transport to arrive with the delivery which will
be verified
against what was expected. The receiving system updates the order
management system on what was received. It also acknowledges the
delivery to the external supplier. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;
Finally, the material received is
stocked to the warehouse. </span></li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">44.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      
      <ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.</span></li>
