      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
65 - Publish Test Method</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #65 describes the integration among stakeholders that either manage or use Test Methods. 
      <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model for exchanging Test Methods. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's own integration efforts.</span>&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">There are a variety of scenarios where Test Methods will be exchanged to support testing, and different systems or business functions will be involved in these scenarios. Some stakeholders involved in exchange of Test Methods include:
<br>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Product Lifecycle Management<br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Order Management<br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Quality Management</p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Lab Information Management</p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Third Party Lab<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This is not a complete list but is meant to be a representative sample of activities that manage or use Test Methods in quality management processes. 
      
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.1 Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"></span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario below contains the participants involved in the interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required approach..</span> <br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with transaction management required but not explicitly defined. <br>
      <br>
This scenario describes a model in which the �owner� of test master data (aka the system of record) interacts with one or more users that need copies of that data. The environment for this integration may be within a single organization or it may include several external organizations. There may be instances where all of the data is contained in the documents and other instances where additional information accompanies the TestMethod documents. </span> <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario assumes that the Product Lifecycle Management component owns the TestMethod description and the instances of data within it. TestMethods are versioned, and this scenario illustrates pushing revisions to users. However, it does not specify how information about prior versions are managed, maintained, or recovered.<br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This scenario contains three participants: Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Quality Management, and Laboratory Management. <br>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Typical capabilities of these participants are described: <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">PLM manages the definition of the product, what equipment is required to produce and test the product, the qualification of the equipment, and provisioning of the equipment at a facility that produces or tests the product.  <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Both Lab Management and Third Party Lab participants use an application often referred to a Lab Information Management Systems (LIMS).  LIMS will manage testing services, and collect data off test instruments.  
<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">LIMS system may receive equipment definition information from the PLM system, but the configuration of that equipment is still performed within the LIMS system.  </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Maintenance and calibration schedules may be defined in the LIMS system and have access to maintenance records, potential stored in another application.  </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">A Third Party Lab should manage its own equipment, however, may receive TestMethod(s) from a customer.  A Third Party Lab is not included in this scenario, but may replace Lab Management in those specific implementations. </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The Quality Management participant could receive TestMethod(s) from the PLM system to validate compliance that specific tests were performed in order to produce a Certificate of Analysis for a lot. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The actual definitions and details of these applications are left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as defined by systems commonly sold in the commercial marketplace today. This definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a direct result of the decision not to define how the processing takes place within any individual application.  <br>
      <br>
Each application must be able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object document), but the internals of the application are not required or desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure that an integration designer can communicate the requirements precisely enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The diagram illustrates the workflow stages involved with the sending and updating a TestMethod. Test methods are formal descriptions of how to perform a particular type of test that is specific to a particular business, line of business, or site.  A test methods is configuration managed master data that may be machine interpretable. Revisions will result in new versions with a different RevisionID and effectivity and will likely cause changes the effectivity of prior versions.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Test Specifications, Test Results, and Certificates of Analyses typically include references to Test Methods. Test Methods are tracked, and should be preserved / archived for later examination.  Audits may trace back to methods used in order to to determine procedures, equipment, and/or standards used when particular tests were conducted.  While no particular strategy is prescribed for managing versions, it is recommended that either references to Test Methods directly include version information or that effectivity histories for Test Method versions are kept so that the date of testing could be used to infer the version of the Test Method employed for any given test.
<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The sequence diagram illustrates, with arrows, the messages exchanged, and their responses.  A ConfirmBOD provides an acknowledgement to the initial request indicating that the request was received and understood as a valid.  An Acknowledge(noun) message indicates that the transaction was processed (committed), and a business person has reviewed and provided information related to the next step (accepted, rejected, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      </span>
	 <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The data exchanges involved within the business process are as follows.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The first business event in the integration scenario is the transfer of a new test method from Product Lifecycle Management to Quality Management. This uses the ProcessTestMethod BOD. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">In second business event, Quality Management acknowledges its receipt and filing of the new test method using the AcknowledgeTestMethod BOD.  
<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The third business event is the transfer of the same test method from Product Lifecycle Management to Laboratory Management, using the ProcessTestMethod BOD.  Both #1 and #3 could have used the SyncTestMethod BOD if publish/subscribe was utilized.  </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">In fourth business event, Laboratory Management acknowledges its receipt and filing of the new test method using AcknowledgeTestMethod BOD.  </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The fifth business event in the integration scenario is the transfer of a revision to an existing TestMethod from Product Lifecycle Management to Quality Management.  This uses the SyncTestMethod BOD, since the PLM or middleware is likely using a pub/sub approach.  ChangeTestMethod BOD may also be used to for direct integrations between applications that are not using pub/sub.
 </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Quality Management acknowledges the revision of the test method using the SyncResponseTestMethod BOD in the sixth event. </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The seventh business event in the integration scenario is the transfer of a revision to an existing TestMethod from Product Lifecycle Management to Laboratory Management.  This uses the SyncTestMethod BOD, since the PLM or middleware is likely using a pub/sub approach.  ChangeTestMethod BOD may also be used to for direct integrations between applications that are not using pub/sub. </span></li>
         <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Laboratory Management acknowledges the revision of the test method using the SyncResponseTestMethod BOD in the final event.</span></li>
      </ol>
      
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">65.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception handling is highly localized as the result of how business capabilities are implemented including the deployed infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straightforward and has no additional needs:
</span><br>


      
      
      <ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving application to communicate to the sending application that the information it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be processed. 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the information was not received or understood, or contained errors of any type, it is accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was not acted on.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">In the absence of a Confirm BOD within a previously agreed time limit (e.g., SLA, normally defined in an out-of-band agreement), the originator will resend the original message. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation, it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.</span></li>
      </ul>
