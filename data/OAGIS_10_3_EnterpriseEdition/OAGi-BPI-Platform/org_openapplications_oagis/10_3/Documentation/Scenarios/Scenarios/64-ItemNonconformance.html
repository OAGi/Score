64 - Item
NonConformance</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #64
describes several integration scenarios for reporting item or product
non-conformance (failure to meet some specified values or criteria).
      <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span>&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Many
applications create data that report Item Conformance. <br>
      <br>
Some of
these components include: </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Shopfloor Management Systems (MES)<br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Supplier Management (ERP)<br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Engineering (PDM)</p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Quality Inspection</p>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
          <p>Quality Management System<br>
          <br>
          </p>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.1
Scenario</span></b></h1>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"></span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">These
models are to be used as a design recommendations, not as required
approaches.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: 791px;" alt="Item Non-Conformance Scenario" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/64-ItemNonConformance.jpg"><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
It also presumes that this scenario can be applied as a B2B interaction
between enterprises, as an internal A2A exchange within an enterprise
or as an B2M exchange from a business to a mobile device following the
same canonical business messaging model.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario
describes a model where several software components
report Item Conformance Typically used with Process, Notify or Show
verb. The determination of
which verb is appropriate depends on the specific use case and the
roles of the systems as related to which is the authoritative system of
record (Master) for the aspect of the Item Non-conformance being
communicated. <br>
      <br>
The ItemNonConformance noun can be used to report events related to
Items or Item Instances that do not fulfill specifications or
requirements, either due to discovered exceptions from product
characteristics or due to damage. The ItemNonConformance noun
provides the ability for the sender to report an identified
non-conformance at the level of detail that is required. It also
provides the ability to report the specific non-conformances of a
component/ part while also identifying the parent assembly or another
part as the affected item. <br>
      <br>
The ItemNonConformance noun may be used
to report, initiate, or request actions related to the non-conformance
being reported, including identifying relevant parties and
responsibilities, identifying proximate and root causes, and
identifying immediate disposition (correction) action for the Item
Instance as well as long term corrective action for the Item
definition. Financial, Order, or accounting information may be provided
for reference purposes as ReferenceDocument elements. <br>
      <br>
This
noun addresses a subset of the uses cases of EDI 842 NonConformance
Report, and some of the workflows required by ISO9001 compliant
processes. Typical uses would be from a MES or Shopfloor Management
system, to
report Item instance non-conformance to a supplier management system or
to internal inventory or quality management system, identifying not
only the specific Item instance that has the non-conformance, but also
the affected item, such as the containing assembly, which is now also
unsuitable for use until the component instance non-conformance is
corrected. <br>
      <br>
The Item Nonconformance may also be used from a shopfloor
management system or inspection facility to report general Item
non-conformance issues to an Engineering system, for eventual corrective
action as an engineering change.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains multiple participants or roles: <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Customer
party <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Transportation
party (Carrier) <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Supplier
party </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these participants are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">64.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      
      <ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.</span></li>
