49 - Sales Opportunity</span></b></h1>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #49
describes the integration for partner sales systems to integrate with
supplier sales systems for opportunities. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <br>
The purpose of this
scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.1
Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.<br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
The environment for this integration is typically within an
enterprise and/or within divisions. The environment for a second
integration using this scenarios is typically between two enterprises. <br>
      <br>
This scenario also assumes that one application will maintain the master
data for integration.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario contains two participants or roles: a partner sales system
that is designed to provide information concerning sales opportunities
and a supplier party and system that is
interested in providing goods or services. </span> <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario
contains the following events in the workflow sequence:<br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Submission
of a sales opportunity to a supplier system and the acknowledgment of
what was then accomplished in the supplier system</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">A
request to see an opportunity and the corresponding reply to that
request</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
chance to change or update an opportunity with a response as to the
details and success of that request </span></li>
      </ol>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">49.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
