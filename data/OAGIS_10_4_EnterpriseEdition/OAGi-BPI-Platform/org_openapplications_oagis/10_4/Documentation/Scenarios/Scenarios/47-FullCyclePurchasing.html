      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
47 - Full Cycle Purchasing</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #47
describes the integration of full cycle purchasing of inventory
goods through the interface points between buyer and supplier systems. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
scenario diagram below shows an integration that involves a buyer
with a purchasing system, receiving system, and an accounts payable
system interacting with the supplier side which consists of an order
management system, a shipping system, and a billing system. Typically
the&nbsp; buyer places an order through their purchasing system which
then interacts with the seller's order management system wherein the
order is acknowledged. The inventory system fulfills the order internal
to
the seller and the shipping system notifies the buyer that the shipment
has
been made by the buyer's system. The receiving system receives the
shipment and the seller's billing system issues an invoice to the
buyer's system. </span> <dt><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.1
Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment for this
integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenarios describes a model for production execution. The environment
for this first part of this integration is typically within an
enterprise and within a division. The environment for the second part
of this
integration is typically between two enterprises. <br>
      <br>
This scenario also assume that one application will maintain the master
data for integration.</span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains two participants or overall roles: <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Buyer -
the party who is purchasing <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Seller
- the party who is providing the requested good or service. <br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Participant
applications typically consists of: <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The buyer's purchasing system, receiving system and accounts payable system
          <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The seller's order management system, shipping system and billing system</span></li>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note that the
buyer's systems (purchasing, receiving, and accounts payable systems)
could
be part of a single or possibly within different ERP systems within the
buying enterprise. Likewise the seller's systems (order management,
shipping, and billing systems) could be part of a single or possibly
separate
ERP systems in the seller's enterprise.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able to perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. <br>
      </span> <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
The scenario
contains the following events in the workflow sequence. <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Something
within the Buyer organization identifies the need to purchase something
and a supplier is found. These steps
are not addressed in this scenario, but are addressed in other OAGIS
scenarios.&nbsp;</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The actual
sequence consists of: <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">A
purchase order is issued to the supplier and received by the suppliers order management system. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
order management system chooses to accept, reject,
or suggest modifications to the purchase order which triggers&nbsp;
acknowledgment of
the purchase order being sent back to the buyer's purchasing system.
From that point there can be a series of
exchanges to address terms, conditions and availability. This dialog
can
occur using ChangePurchaseOrder BOD not shown in this workflow. This
Workflow assumes that the order is accepted and confirmed with the
Acknowledge PurchaseOrder. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Next
step is for the order management system to communicate the
order to the inventory system such that the order can be picked and
sent
to shipping. Since this communication is internal to the seller it is
not shown here. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Next
step is for the seller's shipping system to pack the order and send via
a carrier. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Once
the order is packed and advanced shipping notice (ASN) is sent to the
buyer's system via the ShowDelivery BOD. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Next
step is for the buyer's receiving system to receive the ASN and
prepare for the shipment followed by the actual physical shipment.
Typically, the shipment then would be stored in inventory at the
buyer's receiving location. It may also be sent to
inspection depending upon the situation. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Next
step is for the seller's billing system to issue an invoice for the
goods sent according to the terms agreed to in the purchase order.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Finally,
the Buyer's accounts payable system acknowledges receipt and payment of
the
Invoice. <br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">47.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
<br>
          <br>
