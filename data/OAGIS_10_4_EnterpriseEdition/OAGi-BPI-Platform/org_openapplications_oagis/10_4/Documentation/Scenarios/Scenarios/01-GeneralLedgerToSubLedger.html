      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
1 - General Ledger to Sub Ledgers</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">1.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario
#1 describes the integration for general ledger software integrating
with
a sub-ledger
software or multiple sub-ledger applications. <br>
      <br>
The purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of
the participants and the dialogs between them for this type of
integration. This is one model that may be used to
design one's own integration based on the specific needs of an
organization or group of organizations. <br>
      <br>
Many applications create data that cause changes to account balances of
a general ledger application. Some of those
sub-applications have activity which will be reflected in a general
ledger
application. They can include: </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Benefits</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Costing&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Human
Resources <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Inventory
Control <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Manufacturing&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Payroll
          <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Production</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Treasury</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> Although not
a complete list, this is meant to be a representative sample
of activities that generates a journal entry scenario and would use
these messages for interaction.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">1.1
Scenario</span></b></h1>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"></span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
shown below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between the them,
certain assumptions about the sequence of events, and about
the technical approach, such as publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
This example is to be used as a design recommendation.<br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">1.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment for this
integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
      <br>
It describes a model for one or more sub ledger applications
integrating with a common general ledger application. The environment
for
this integration may be within a single enterprise, across several
divisions or across partnerships. There may be instances where the
amount of information sent
to the general ledger is sufficient to accomplish a goal, and there may
be times when the sub
ledgers applications need to send the detailed transaction data to a
cost accounting application. <br>
      <br>
This scenario does not cover posting to a cost accounting component.
Please refer to other Scenarios for posting. <br>
      <br>
This scenario also assumes
that the details of the financial
transactions will be owned by or kept in the sub ledgers and because of
that, the drill back
mechanism from the general ledger application is also described in a
later Scenarios.<br>
      </span> <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">1.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This Scenario
contains two major participants: the general ledger application
and the sub-ledger application(s). <br>
      <br>
The definitions and details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able to perform the services defined by the message BOD (Business Object
Document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The most important factors in defining these participants are to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements and
design precisely
enough to define the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. </span>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">1.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      <br>
For Scenario #1 the sequence includes: </span>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
first business event in the sequence should be the synchronization of
the financial chart of accounts to ensure full, traceable continuity.
This scenario assumes that the general
ledger </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">owns
the chart of accounts definition and the instances of data within it.
This means that sub ledger applications have several choices for
validation of
account numbers and other fields in the complete chart of accounts
structure with one of these choices being to synchronize the chart of
accounts
structure and data from the general ledger application.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">ConfirmBOD
is next used to assure that the sync has been received and is
acceptable to the sub ledger.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">PostJournalEntry
is next used to inform the general ledger of the known or desired
changes.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">AcknowledgeJournalEntry
is then used to affirm what the post requested and was accomplished. It
is assumed that the Post and Acknowledge BODs reflect the same details
and if not the sub ledger will then be forced into some form of
reconciliation such as a re-sync and attempt the post a second time.<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <h1><small><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><small>1.5 Exception
Handling</small></font></b></small></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>
      <ul>
        
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
