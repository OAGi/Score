38 - Unit of Measure Exchange</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">38.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #38
describes the integration for supporting Unit-Of-Measure (UOM)
information flows associated with items being managed as inventory. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
integration scenario extends OAGIS by addressing the need for
applications to exchange alternative UOM information beyond the
stocking UOM. While the stocking level UOM provides for basic inventory
accounting
functionality, it may not be the most efficient, common or natural UOM
for manufacturing, purchasing, selling or handling the item. The item
may be packaged into standardized or supplier-specific bulk quantities
for import/export, wholesale, or retail sales (for example: Each, Box,
Case, Pallet, etc). The item may be also utilized in manufacturing,
inspection or other processes in fixed quantity amounts that may be
both common (Pair, Dozen, Gross, etc) or item-specific (Tray, Set,
Spool, etc). The materials management, inventory control, warehousing
and
receiving/shipping departments within an organization require the
packaging relationship details between UOMs and the handling
characteristics for each UOM to effectively manage the flow and storage
of inventory. The UOM information flows in this integration scenario
also incorporate
the Uniform Code Council's "best practices" for item and packaging
container identification standards by supporting a unique bar code
identifier at each packaging level. The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE) provides Codes
for Unit of Measure Used in International Trade through
Recommendations Number 20. UNECE Recommendation Number 20 is an
international standard for unit of measure codes that is suggested to
be used. <br>

Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <img src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/38-UnitOfMeasureExchange.jpg" style="width: 643px; height: 450px;" alt="Unit of Measure Exchange Scenario"><br>
      <br>
      </span><br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">38.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario describes the model for a central materials management
component to communicate information about items and their associated
UOM relationships to one or more subscribing components. This scenario
is designed to support both event-driven (using Sync and Notify BOD
verbs) and request/reply (using Get, and Show BOD verbs) modes of
application-to-application communication. The flow of item and UOM
information is generally outward toward the
subscribing components. However, the Sync verb does permit
bi-directional flow, allowing for the possibility of a subscribing
system to attempt to synchronize certain item characteristics on the
master database. This scenario assumes that central master application
will only update auxiliary item attribute information that it does not
"own" (per the original scenario diagram processing notes for Sync
ItemMaster). In such a bi-directional sync scenario, the determination
of item characteristic ownership and update processing rules is left to
the designer of the specific implementation. <br>
      <br>
The environment for this integration is application-to-application
(A2A) within a single enterprise, or extended across enterprises where
there is a single master application that manages the assignment of all
item identifiers. For business-to-business (B2B) environments where
there is no master or common set of item identifiers, an item catalog
containing item cross-reference information is required to correlate
item definitions between business partners. <br>
      <br>

Integration Scenario more information. </span> <dt><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">38.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This Scenario
contains two major participants: the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">materials management and
inventory </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">applications.
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
In this
integration scenario, the materials management component is considered
to be the owner and source of all item and UOM information. For
example, the materials management component may be the
material/inventory management subsystem of a SAP R/3 or Oracle
Applications ERP system. A subscribing application with an independent
data store for item/UOM
information would typically function in event-driven mode, receiving
synchronization updates at an "as required" or periodic interval. A
subscribing application without an independent data store for
item/UOM information would typically function in request/reply mode. <br>
      <br>
The materials management application or other subscribing applications
may manage the item's UOM &amp; packaging relationships as an intrinsic
part of each item definition (item-dependent) or as entirely separate
groupings that are later associated with one or more items
(item-independent). The item-dependent UOM methodology tends to be
found in some legacy
inventory management applications, while the item-independent UOM
methodology reflects a more modern, normalized data approach. However
both methodologies are commonly found in various applications present
in today's marketplace. <br>
      <br>
The Sync &amp; ShowItemMaster BODs are intended for use when the
materials management component or the subscribing application only
supports the item-dependent UOM methodology. They also are intended for
use when both the
Materials Management component and subscribing application mutually
support the item-independent UOM methodology. They are still used to
transfer item attribute information
and a reference to the UOM relationship. <br>
      <br>
The following example may help explain the differences between the
item-dependent and item-independent UOM methodologies; <span style="font-family: Symbol;"></span>Pre-recorded DVDs from the same
vendor/distributor are
quite likely to have the same bulk packaging relationship regardless of
the information contained on the disks. Suppose the UOM packaging
relationship is:<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><em><strong></strong></em>DVD
disks per
inner pack Box</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">4 inner
pack Boxes
per Case</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">20
Cases per Pallet</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">For inventory
systems managing many DVD titles with an item-independent UOM
methodology, the above packaging relationship only needs to be defined
and sent to a subscribing application once. Updates only reference the existing packaging
relationship.<span style="font-family: Symbol;"></span> For
inventory
systems managing many DVD titles with an item-dependent UOM
methodology, the above packaging relationship must be repeatedly
entered and sent for each item definition.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <span style="margin-left: 0.5in;"></span> </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
The item-independent UOM methodology can significantly reduce the
amount of redundant UOM &amp; packaging data that must be maintained
and sent, especially in an inventory situation having many thousands of
similar items. </span> <dt><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">38.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      <br>
      </span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><b>Event
Driven Mode</b> (using Sync BODs):</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"></span> The first business
event is definition of a UOM code value (such as "Each", "Case" or
"Pallet") in the materials master application.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
communication
flow is only necessary if the subscribing component requires UOM code
values be defined prior to the definition of UOM quantity
relationships.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
next business
event is determined by the item-dependent or item-independent nature of
the materials management component.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If
item-dependent,
the item and its attributes are typically defined prior to, or at the
same time as, the item's UOM relationships in the component.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If
item-independent,
the UOM relationships are typically defined prior to the item
definition. <b></b></span></li></ul><br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">38.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
