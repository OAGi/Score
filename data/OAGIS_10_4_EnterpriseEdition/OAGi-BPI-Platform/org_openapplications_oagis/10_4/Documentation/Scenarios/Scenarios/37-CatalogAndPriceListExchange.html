      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #37
describes the integration for order management, inventory control, catalog
management and purchasing software. <br>

      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating these
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.<br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">37.1
Scenario<br>
      </span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.<br>

      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">37.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined. <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
This scenario describes a model for one or more catalog components
integrating with a procurement system. <br>
      <br>
The environment for this
integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.
There are many possible business applications in several environments
that may use this capability. For example, a manufacturing,
distributor, or reseller business application could use this to
communicate requirements to synchronize a catalog. It may also be
necessary to support component supplier management (CSM)
scenarios. In such a scenario a company will provide a service of
sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a
consolidated catalog. A customer purchases the product from the catalog
provider. They have the capability to do comparison shopping from the
catalog. Supplier certification may be provided by the catalog provider.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">37.3
Component Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains four major participants; order management, inventory control, catalog management, and a&nbsp; purchasing
application. <br>
      <br>
The definitions of these components are left to the designer but are
assumed to contain the functionality as defined by what is commonly
sold in the commercial market place today. The following assumptions
are made regarding the components:<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
order management application
maintains item pricing information</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The inventory system maintains the item masters of the existing inventory<br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
catalog management system application represents the catalog management
system of the catalog provider<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purchasing application represents
the purchasing system of a customer or a catalog subscriber </span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Additional
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants are to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their
interrelationships.<br>
      </span><br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">37.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario contains the following events in the workflow sequence: </span>
      <br>
<ol>
        
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> Syncing of the item master data from the inventory system to all the other systems<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Syncing of the catalog&nbsp; between the order management and catalog systems</span></li>

        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Syncing of the pricing to the catalog system&nbsp;</span></li>
        
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Show of both the catalog and the pricing to the purchasing system<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">37.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
