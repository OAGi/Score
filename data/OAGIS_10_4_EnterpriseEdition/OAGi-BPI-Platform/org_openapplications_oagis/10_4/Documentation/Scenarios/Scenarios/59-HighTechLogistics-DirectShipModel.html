      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
59 - High Tech Logistics - Direct Ship Model</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario
#59 describes the integration for customer party applications to
integrate with a supplier party application along with a transportation
party (Carrier) application to accomplish what the high tech industry
calls direct ship. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.1
Scenario<br>
      </span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
      </span> <img style="width: 843px; height: 681px;" alt="High Tech Direct Ship Logistics Scenario" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/59-HTLogistics%28L%29-DirectShip.jpg"><br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
It also presumes that this scenario can be applied as a B2B interaction
between enterprises, as an internal A2A exchange within an enterprise
or as an B2M exchange from a business to a mobile device following the
same canonical business messaging model.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains three participants or roles: <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Customer
party <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Transportation
party (Carrier) <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Supplier
party </span></li>
      </ul>
      <dt><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these participants are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
        <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
        <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. </span>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario
contains the following events in the workflow sequence:<br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Request to process a purchase order to the supplier party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Indicate the acceptance or rejection
of the purchase order <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
a request to pickup a shipment from
the supplier party to the transportation party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Indicate the acceptance or rejection of the shipment from the transportation
party <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate a commercial Invoice to the transportation party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
the shippers letter of instruction to the transportation party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
the export declaration to the transportation party if needed</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
the hazardous material information to the transportation party if needed</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Carrier
pickup occurs</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate that the shipment is leaving from
the supplier party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate that the shipment is leaving to the transportation party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
any updates to the shipment(s)</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Request to process a freight invoice</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Indicate the acceptance or
rejection of the processing of a freight invoice <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
the delivery to the supplier party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate
a request to process an invoice to the supplier party letting the
supplier know that the customer is
initiating the invoice and payment. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Indicate the acceptance or rejection of the invoice from the supplier party</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Communicate that the customer party has initiated the payment <br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">59.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
