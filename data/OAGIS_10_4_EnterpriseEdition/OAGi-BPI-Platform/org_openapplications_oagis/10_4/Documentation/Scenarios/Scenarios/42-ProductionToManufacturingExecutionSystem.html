      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
42 - Production
to Manufacturing Execution System</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #42
describes scenarios which would enable integration of disparate
manufacturing systems applications for production execution. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
scenario below shows an integration that involves a
manufacturing execution system (MES) and a central ERP system. The MES
is shown as the source of production events and activities. The ERP is
shown as the source of related setup events which occur prior to
production. <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.1
Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <br>
      </span> <img style="width: 886px; height: 783px;" alt="Production to MES Scenario" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/42-ProductionToMES.jpg"> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment
for this first integration is typically within an
enterprise and within a division. <br>
      <br>
The environment for this second
integration is typically between two enterprises. <br>
      <br>
This scenarios also assume that one application will maintain the
master data for the integration.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
contains six major application; order management,
inventory, engineering (PDM), manufacturing (ERP), manufacturing
execution (MES) and costing applications.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. </span><br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The events involved include: </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Sync
BOM (Bill of Materials) -&nbsp; Occurs whenever an event triggers a
change or update and ensures correct BOM is used for planning and
production when an order occurs<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Sync
Routing - </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Occurs
whenever an event triggers a change or update and ensures correct
routing is used for planning and production</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Process Sales Order -
Initiates a sales order with the manufacturing (ERP) system to trigger
inventory movements and production</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Sync
Production Order - Initiates the production of the items that
will needed to deliver the order and/or replenish inventory<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Process
Issue Inventory - Updates the inventory management system to the status
of and availability of inventory<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Get
WIP Status - Enables the ERP and MRP to coordinate the exact status of
the production events (can be done with a "push" Show from the MRP on
some preplanned or arranged schedule)<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Process
Allocate Resources - Indicates the actual resources used and how they
are to be allocated to a costing system<br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">42.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      
      <ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.</span></li>
      </ul>
