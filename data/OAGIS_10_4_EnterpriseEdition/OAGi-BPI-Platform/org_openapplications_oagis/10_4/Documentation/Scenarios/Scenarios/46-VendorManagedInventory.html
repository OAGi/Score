      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
46 - Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI)<br>
      </span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">46.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #46
describes integration of a Vendor Managed
Inventory (VMI) consumption of goods. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario is for a buyer of goods to inform the
supplier that goods have been consumed, and replenishment will likely
be required. It is also for a retailer to inform the vendor that retail sales
of goods have been made. <br>
      <br>
This scenario also applies to plant data collection
systems and
warehouse management systems
to inform inventory systems that goods have been consumed and inventory
records should be adjusted accordingly.<br>

Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span> <br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">46.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment for this
integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
environment for this first half of the integration is typically within
an
enterprise and within a division and for this second half of the
integration is typically between two enterprises. <br>
      <br>
It is also assumed that there is a replenishment contract in place that
defines when and how the actual replenishment is to take place<br>
      <br>
This scenario also assume that one application will maintain the master
data for integration. <br>
</span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">46.3
Component Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario contains two overall applications: the sellers/supplier's
applications whom is assumed to be supplying the product or service and
the
application for party who is purchasing.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. <br>
</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">46.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario
contains the following events in the workflow sequence:<br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Not
shown - Overall purchase, replenishment or vendor managed inventory
agreement is in place. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Message
is sent to supplier, distributor or third party logistics
provider that material has been consumed. <br>
          </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is done in response to
events such as these, depending on implementation context:<br>
          </span>
          <ul>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Material is replenished to the manufacturing line at
manufacturing facility.</span></li>
            <li><span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><small>Material
is assembled into final product.</small> </span> </span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Material
is purchased and removed from facility by customer</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Supplier,
distributor, third party logistics provider replenishes
material, using information provided in the Show InventoryConsumption
message, the demand and shipment forecasts, and the terms of the
overall purchase or vendor managed inventory agreement.</span></span><br>
          <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">46.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
