      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
39 - Request for Quote and Quote Exchange</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #39
describes the integration for business software
involved with the Request for Quote (RFQ) and Quote processes. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
Many applications contribute to the generation of RFQs and the
resulting quotes. Some components involved with the distribution of
RFQs and Quotes are: </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Engineering
Product Data Management</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Purchasing
/ Procurement </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span>
          <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Order
Management</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Sales
Force Automation</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This is not a
complete list but is meant to be a representative sample
of activities that generate data involved with the
RequestForQuote/Quote process. <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.1
Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span>
      <img style="width: 723px; height: 906px;" alt="Request for Quote Scenario" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/39-RequestforQuote-QuoteExchange.jpg"><br>

      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
      <br>
This scenario describes a model for one or more purchasing components
integrating with another purchasing or sales order management
component. The environment for this integration may be with a single
external organization or several external organizations. There may be
instances where all of the data is contained in the documents and other
instances where additional binary information accompanies the
RequestForQuote and Quote documents. <br>
      <br>
This scenario assumes that the procurement / purchasing component
"owns" the request definition and the instances of data within it. The
release may be to a known set of partners, open to response from new
partners or issued to an intermediary such an independent trading
exchange. <br>
      <br>
This scenario does not cover the activity between the acceptance of a
quote and the issuing of a purchase order. Similarly, this scenario
does not cover the activity between releasing the quote and generation
of the sale order. Both activities are assumed to be supported by
normal activity of a vendor's application. <br>
      <br>
      </span> <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains two major components: the purchasing or procurement
component of the buyer and the sales order management component of the
supplier. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships. </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
Note that the evolution of eCommerce has yielded independent trading
exchanges and other intermediaries between buyers and suppliers.
Requirements and operations for intermediaries should be similar to
direct links between the two components. <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from right to left. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
exchange
of RequestForQuotes and Quotes may follow several different workflows.
The process depends on the type of product or products involved and the
entities exchanging the documents. The diagram below illustrates the
workflow stages involved with the RequestForQuote / Quote process.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;<img style="width: 498px; height: 374px;" alt="Request for Qutoe Graphic" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/39-40-RequestForQuoteGraphic1.jpg"><br>
      <br>
All workflows within the overall scenario have at least two major
events in the workflow sequence. The diagram above illustrates the life
cycle of the RequestForQuote / Quote process. <br>
      <br>
The Nomination and
Preparation phases are sometimes merged into a single event. The Quote
and Award phases may be merged as well. <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
first business event in the integration scenario is the request
using the RequestForQuote document. This request may be followed by a
period of supplier nomination or culling suppliers into a manageable
short-list. Alternatively, suppliers may be known partners eliminating
the need for the nomination phase. Within the RequestForQuote event,
the sequence of events depends on the nature of the request and the
type of partners involved. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
second business event in the integration scenario is the
response to the request from partners/suppliers in the form of a Quote.
The quote usually matches the line items specified within
RequestForQuote, but may not contain responses to every item. Following
the quote delivery may be a period of negotiation or evaluation of
supplier responses. A quote often represents a binding document that
may change based on
negotiations between the buyer or RequestForQuote *owner* and the
seller responding to the RequestForQuote. These details of these
negotiations should be captured for future reference.&nbsp;</span></li>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">These
workflow sequences focus on the pre-purchase activity for: <br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Quantities
of finished items, parts and/or materials</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Custom,
built-to-order items and/or materials</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Use of
an intermediary to manage the exchange activity for
RequestForQuotes and Quotes</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <b>Quantities of Finished Items</b> <br>
The workflow sequence for quantities of standard items involves the
fewest BODs. The buyer focus involves finding the best price based on
large quantities of individual items and/or aggregate items. BODs
typically involved include: <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Add
RequestForQuote releases a request to one or more partners
providing deadlines for response and item details. ADD is used when the
recipient takes ownership of the RequestForQuote source data. Sync
RequestForQuote is used when the RequestForQuote data persists in
multiple systems <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Add
Quote response by a seller / supplier to one or more items
detailed within an RequestForQuote. Sync Quote is used when the
RequestForQuote data persists in multiple systems. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Respond
Quote a buyer may respond to the quote with questions or
issues. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Change
Quote a supplier may alter a quote during negotiations in
an effort to win the order. <br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The result of
these activities would be a purchase order and sale order
that are covered within other OAGIS Scenarios. </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><b><br>
Custom, Built-To-Order Items</b> <br>
The workflow sequence for custom,
built to order involves more activity
than that of finished goods. The buyer*s focus involves finding the
best price for an item or quantity of items that are not currently
available. A long-term business relationship is often involved leading
to expectations that must be addressed within the quote. Customized
products require a higher level of specification. Individual
supplier inquiries may be answered formally for all participants to
insure competitive parity. Conversely, buyers may have questions
related to an individual quote that lead to a change. BODs typically
involved include: <br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Add /
Sync RequestForQuote releases a request to one or more
partners providing deadlines for response and item details. Add is used
when the recipient takes ownership of the RequestForQuote source data.
Sync RequestForQuote is used when the RequestForQuote data persists in
multiple systems. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Respond
RequestForQuote suppliers respond with questions and/or
clarification issues. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Change
RequestForQuote a request is modified to include answers to
questions or clarification of specifications. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Add
Quote response by a seller / supplier to one or more items
detailed within an RequestForQuote. Add Quote is used when the
recipient takes ownership of the Quote source data. Sync Quote is used
when the Quote data persists in multiple systems. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Respond
QUOTE buyer response to an individual supplier with
questions, clarifications or issues. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Change
Quote a supplier may alter a quote during negotiations in
an effort to win the order. <br>
          </span></li>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The result of
these activities would be a purchase order and sale order
that are covered </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">within other OAGIS
Scenarios.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">39.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
