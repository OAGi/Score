      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
73 - Standalone MRP to Standalone MES</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario #73 describes the integration of disparate material requirements planning (MRP) and manufacturing systems (MES) applications. </span>&nbsp; 
      <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model for integrating MRP applications to MES applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's own integration efforts.</span>&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario diagram below shows an integration that involves a manufacturing execution system (MES) and a central MRP system. The MES is shown as the source of production events and activities. The MRP is shown as the source of related setup events which occur prior to production. 
</span>&nbsp;
<br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.1 Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"></span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario below contains the participants involved in the interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the technical approach. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required approach.</span> <br>

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with transaction management required but not explicitly defined. 
      <br>
The environment for this integration may be within a single enterprise, or across enterprises.   </span> <br>
      <br>
  

<br>
     
      
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.3
Participant Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario contains two major applications; material requirements planning (MRP) and manufacturing execution (MES). <br>
      </span>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. 
<br>
      <br>
      </span>

      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This scenario has the following major events in the workflow sequence: 
<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Then the process excises the processing an Work Order:
			<ul>
				<li>Process a Work Order and Acknowledge.</li>
				<li>Send Sync to MRP with and updates from MES.</li>
				<li>The MES can send a Cancel.</li>
				<li>The MES sends a Notify when work is complete. </li>
				
			</ul>
<br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>

 <br> 

      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">73.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and has no additional needs:
</span><br>


      
      
      <ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the most obvious method for providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between business software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use of the Confirm BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from integration to integration. 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving application to communicate to the sending application that the information it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be processed. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">ï¿½	If the information was not received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to time limit to resend the original message again.  <br>
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation, it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.
