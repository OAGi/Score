      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Scenario
35 - ERP to
Finite Scheduling and MES</span></b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.0
Overview</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Scenario
#35 describes the integration for manufacturing (ERP), manufacturing
production planning, manufacturing execution (MES) and manufacturing
capacity analysis software for production planning. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
purpose of this scenario is to enable the visualization of the
participants in the process and the dialogs between them for this
specific integration. This scenario is not meant to be the only model
for integrating general ledger applications to a budget
applications. This is simply one model that may be used to guide one's
own integration efforts.</span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.1
Scenario Diagram</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The scenario
below contains the participants involved in the
interaction, the dialog flows or conversation between them, certain
assumptions about the sequence of events, and assumptions about the
technical approach, for example, publish and subscribe.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
is a model to be used as a design recommendation, not a required
approach.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      </span> <img style="width: 845px; height: 746px;" alt="Engineering Resources Planning to Manufacturing Execution System Scenariio" src="../OAGIS_Scenarios_GraphicsFiles/35-ERPToFiniteSched+MES.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.2
Assumptions</span></b></h1>
      
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">This
scenario assumes a loosely coupled, asynchronous approach with
transaction management required but not
explicitly defined.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The environment for
this integration is typically within an enterprise
and within a division. <br>
      <br>
This scenario also assumes that one application
will maintain the
master data for integration. <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> </span> <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.3
Component Definitions</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> This
scenario contains four major participants: production planning,
manufacturing, manufacturing execution, and the ERP application.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
definitions and
details of these
applications are
left to the designer but are assumed to contain the functionality as
defined by what is commonly sold in the commercial market place today.
This
definition is broadly accepted by the scenario designers and is a
direct result of the decision not to
define how the
processing takes place within any individual application. <br>
      <br>
Each
application must be
able to perform the services defined by the message BOD (business object
document), but the internals of the application are not
required or
desired to be exposed at this level of standardized abstraction. <br>
      <br>
The
most important factors in defining these participants is to ensure
that an integration designer can communicate the requirements&nbsp;
precisely
enough to detail the interfaces needed and their interrelationships.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></span><br>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.4
Business Workflow (Sequence)</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
business workflow is graphically represented by starting at the
Scenario top and reading from top down and from left to right. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br>
      <br>
This scenario
contains the following events in the workflow sequence: <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">When a new Item is added to the ERP system, it is
automatically synchronized out to the other applications. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Typically the
next step is to create a production order. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">These production orders are then sent to capacity analysis and scheduling components. This includes the production
order, bill of materials (BOM) and routing. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Scheduling component creates a list of tasks to be done, in order to
fulfill production orders. <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If a
disruption occurs in the manufacturing process a Manufacturing
system can request to the list<br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Upon
completion of these tasks, the manufacturing system updates the
ERP and capacity analysis systems are updated with the WIP in progress
and the confirmation of issues of materials. </span></li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">35.5
Exception Handling</span></b></h1>
      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Exception
handling is highly localized as the result of an implementation's
infrastructure, management and business rules. As such, this section of
the Scenario documentation is planned to be used as a
guide to help understand the additional intent of these Scenarios. If no exceptions are noted here, then it can be assumed that
the Scenario designers agreed that the Scenario is straight forward and
has no additional needs:</span><br>


      
      <ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Note
that the Confirm BOD is not shown in the scenario and that it is the
most obvious method for
providing an application level exception and feedback mechanism between
business
software components. Full Confirm BOD use is described in other OAGIS
documentation in detail, but it should be noted that the specific use
of the Confirm
BOD may vary significantly from scenario to scenario and from
integration to integration.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The
Confirm BOD is typically intended to be used by the original receiving
application to communicate to the sending application that the
information
it sent in the message BOD (business object document) was received and understood and can be
processed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">If the
information was not
received or nor understood, or contained errors of any type, it is
accepted practice for the OAGIS users to presume that the data was
not acted on and in the absence of a Confirm BOD within a partnership previously agreed to
time limit to resend the original message again. <br>
          </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">As errors and assumptions are the bane of any implementation,
it is strongly recommended that the Confirm BOD be used to prevent any
potential problem although it is not a requirement by OAGIS use.<br>
          <br>
          </span></li>
