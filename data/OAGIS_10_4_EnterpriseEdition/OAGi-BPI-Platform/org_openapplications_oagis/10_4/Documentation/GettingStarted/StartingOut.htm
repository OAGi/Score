<p>If you are looking to integrate business applications, business units or
supply chains and don't know where to begin. Start with the OAGIS Scenarios.
These provide several example integration using the OAGIS. Once you find one
that matches or somewhat matches you needs it is easy to identify the BODs that
are needed for your integration. </p>
<p>If you already now the message that you need to exchange look for the message
in the OAGIS Documentation. Remember OAGIS is a horizontal specification and as
such we may not call a BOD or an field the same. It is important to look at the
semantic meaning and not just the tag name.</p>
<p>If you find that you need an additional BOD(s), contact <a href="mailto:xml@openapplications.org">xml@openapplications.org</a>.
