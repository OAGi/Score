The response to the GetReceiveDelivery request is ShowReceiveDelivery.

For expected deliveries, the ShowReceiveDelivery document content may act as a receiving template or checklist to identify the quantity and shipping configuration of the expected goods.  The ShowReceiveDelivery supports describing shipment content at either the line item level and/or the ship unit level.  Intermediate transportation/logistics providers or freight forwarding partners can use this document to acknowledge the receipt of entire shipping units without detailing the corresponding contents. </xsd:documentation>
