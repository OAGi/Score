                        <xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/10">The purpose of the GetPriceList is to enable a business application module or system to request information concerning new or existing product price lists.

This BOD may be necessary to address the Make to Order, Assemble to Order, or Mixed Mode business ordering scenarios in an Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a Manufacturing, distributor or reseller business application could use this to communicate the price change or request a price list.

It may also be necessary to support Component Supplier Management (CSM) scenarios. In this scenario a company will provide a service of sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a consolidated catalog. A customer purchases the product from the Catalog provider.  They have the capability to do comparison shopping from the catalog. Supplier Certification may be provided by the Catalog provider.

This definition of price list is intended to support simple pricing scenario, especially pricing that may accompany a published price list.  It is not intended to support complex pricing environments that may be needed to support features such as;

·         Deals and Promotions

·         Coupons and Sales Incentives

·         Rebates and Accruals

This functionality will be addressed in a subsequent release.  It is a working assumption that the representation of complex qualifications, coupons and sales incentives are rarely communicated between systems.
