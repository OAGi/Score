This is done by defining the additional information in XML Schema and referencing the new schema in the xml instance document through the use of namespaces. Once this is done the additional information defined there can be carried in the BOD XML instance document.

The Open Applications Group will make best efforts to quickly consider all proposed submissions.The Extension is always the last element in all components, except where the component has been extended inline.</xsd:documentation>
