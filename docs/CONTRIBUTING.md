   - After that the issue may traverse through the follow cards a few rounds in various orders. These cards only serve as indications that the issue has been through these stages. In some cases, with multiple developers working on the same issue, some of these activities can occur in parallel, e.g., writing test assertions (in detail) may happen at the same time as coding. Comments may be made in the issue when some of these tasks are not needed for the issue. 
     - Fork the current Score repo to developer's private repo. 
     - "Writing Test Assertion"

  - If pull request is accepted, the person who merges the content close the issue. The issue automatically goes to the Close card.
  - If the pull request is not accepted, the developer may cycle through the above tasks again or simply put it back in the "Debugging" card.
  - If the merge causes failure in routine test, a new issue should be created that optionally citing the original issue.
