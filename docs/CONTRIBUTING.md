  - Overview of test script development and execution
  - Read user guide or at least read its content.
- How to contribute  
  - Fork the current Score repo to developer's private repo.
  - Create an issue if one does not exist
  - Discuss issue in the Score meeting
    - If issue is accepted,
      - assign label bug, enhancement, or design change
    - If issue is not accepted, then close issue.
  - When start working on the issue.
    - Assign milestone and project
    - Make sure that a specific branch for a specific milestone and issue exists (e.g., 'develop/2.4/1291' branch for the issue #1291 in the 2.4 milestone. 'develop/2.4/1291' branch will be merged into 'develop/2.4', and 'develop/2.4' will be merged into 'develop'.)
    - Once entered a project, the issue is placed on "To DO" card.
  - After that, the issue may traverse through the following cards a few rounds in various order. These cards only serve as indications that the issue has been through these stages. In some cases, with multiple developers working on the same issue, some of these activities can occur in parallel, e.g., writing test assertions (in detail) may happen at the same time as coding. Comments may be made in the issue when some of these tasks are not needed for the issue. 
    - "Writing Test Assertion" 
    - "Coding and Unit Testing"
    - "Implementing test script"
    - "Debugging" - This means executing the test and may also be changing content associated with other tasks.
    - "Updating user guide"
  - Once, all of the above tasks are done, create a pull request. Alternatively, a pull request can be created after every task. Comments indicating the specific task and the issue the pull request is about should be provided.
  - If all tasks are completed for the issue, the person who merges the content closes the issue. The issue automatically goes to the Close card.
  - If the pull request is not accepted, the developer may cycle through the above tasks again or simply put it back in the "Debugging" card.
  - If the merge causes a failure in a routine test, a new issue should be created that optionally cites the original issue.
