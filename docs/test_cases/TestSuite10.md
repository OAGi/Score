# Test Suite 10

We did think about using the concept of project (which like a branch). In that case, users need to create a CC Release Project first. Users can create multiple CC Release Projects at the same time. Each release project is like a branch so the project has a snapshot from a release. This would allow users to create a bug fix release from any prior release. But this would mean we have to create a merging feature. Also, typically, OAGi does not go back and create a fix for prior release. So, we can say that the current tool design only allows linear management of core component releases.

If we do however let the user work on BIEs based on any prior release and user extension to those BIEs can be created within those releases. Then, it is sort of like a branch. And we would like to create a sort of a merge functionality. It is not a merge per se because it is more like an alignment, i.e., the core components (the standard) always win.

## Test Case 10.1

## Test Case 10.4

> Editing associations of a brand-new developer ACC

Pre-condition: The brand-new ACC is created by the developer and is in the WIP state. The developer accesses these functionalities by opening the brand-new ACC from the CC list page or after creating a brand-new ACC according to Test Assertion #1 of the Test Case 10.2.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #10.4.1
The developer can append a developer ASCCP to the ACC (maybe by right-clicking the ACC) that results in an association to a developer ASCCP. The default value of the new ASCC shall be as follows: Min = 0, Max = “unbounded”, Deprecated = false and disabled, Definition=empty, Definition Source=empty.

##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.a
The developer ASCCP can be in any state.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.b
A warning shall be given if the ASCCP is deprecated.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.c
The ACC shall not already contain an ASCCP or BCCP with the same property term whether in itself or within its based ACC. (maybe, the ASCCP with the same property should not appear in the list of the dialog used to append ASCCPs. Note that there may be multiple ASCCPs with the same property term even in the same release – this situation occurs with the Data Area ASCCP. But maybe easier to test if giving error after a problematic ASCCP is selected). The test should account for the cases of group ASCCP – 1) there is a group in the based ACC, the developer appends a non-group ASSCP that has the same property term as a property in the group of the based ACC; 2) there is a group in the based ACC, the developer appends a group ASCCP that has a child with the same property term as a property in the group of the based ACC; 3) The ACC has a group ASCCP and the developer appends an ASCCP that has the same property term as a property in the group; 4) The ACC has a group ASCCP and the developer appends another group ASCCP that cause the two groups to have some duplicate property terms; 5) same as (1) to (4) but groups have a cascaded a group.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.d
The resulting ASCC shall be in the WIP state.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.e

##### Test Assertion #10.4.1.f
No end user ASCCP can be selected.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.2
The developer can right-click on any associations and Insert an ASCCP before or after. The rest of the behavior is the same as test assertion #1.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.3
The developer can update the following fields of its new ASCC (rev = 1); Min, Max, Definition, Definition Source. I.e., he cannot update the details of the ASCCP. The following business rules are applied:

##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.a
Min >= 0
##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.b
Max >= -1 and (Max >= Min when Max != -1)
##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.c
The user may type in “unbounded” in place of -1 for Max. If the user type in -1 for Max, the UI should display it as “unbounded”.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.d
Min, Max, and Deprecated are required.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.e
A warning should be given when the Definition is empty.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.3.f
Deprecated must be false and locked (because it is a new association, it shouldn’t be deprecated).

#### Test Assertion #10.4.4
The developer can append a developer BCCP to an ACC (maybe by right clicking the ACC) that results in an association to the developer BCCP. The default value of the new BCC shall be as follows: Min=0, Max = “unbounded”, Deprecated = false and disabled, Entity Type = Element, Value Constraint= None (Default and Fixed value should be empty), Definition = empty, Definition Source = empty.

##### Test Assertion #10.4.4.a

##### Test Assertion #10.4.4.d
The resulting BCC shall be in the WIP state.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.5
No end user BCCP can be selected.The developer can right-click on any associations and choose insert a BCCP before or after it. The rest of the behavior is the same as test assertion #4.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.6
The developer can edit the following info of a BCC - Min, Max, Entity Type, Default or Fixed Value, Definition, and Definition Source. He cannot update the BCCP information. The following business rules apply:

##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.a
Min >= 0
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.b
Max >= -1 and (Max >= Min when Max != -1)
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.c
The user may type in “unbounded” in place of -1 for Max. If the user type in -1 for Max, the UI should display it as “unbounded”.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.d
All fields except Definition and Definition Source are required. However, a warning should be given when the Definition is empty.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.e
Deprecated must be false (because it is a new association, it shouldn’t be deprecated).
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.f
The Default and Fixed value shall be disabled and cleared of value if the Entity Type is Element. The system shall warn the user that the Default and Fixed Value will be cleared if changing entity type to Element. If enabled, the Default and Fixed value shall be mutually exclusive.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.g
The Attribute Entity Type can be applied only if the BCCP has no SC or all SCs have max cardinality zero.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.6.h
If the Entity Type is changed from Element to Attribute the Min Cardinality should be changed to 0 and the Max Cardinality to 1.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.7
The developer can change (move up or down) the sequence of an association to an ASCCP. It would be good to be able to drag-n-drop instead of moving up or down.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.8
The developer can change (move up or down) the sequence of an association to a BCCP. It would be good to be able to drag-n-drop instead of moving up or down.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.9
The developer can remove an association (ASCC or BCC), there must be a confirmation dialog box though. (In that case, the association information is stored in the history record).

#### Test Assertion #10.4.10
The developer can assign another developer ACC belonging to the working branch as a base of this ACC.

##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.a
The base ACC can be in any state.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.b
If the chosen base ACC is deprecated, a warning shall be given.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.c
The base ACC shall only be Base or Semantics component type (not be a Group, User Extension Group, or Embedded component type, etc.).
##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.d
The developer cannot change the fields of the base ACC.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.e
End user ACC cannot be selected as a base.
##### Test Assertion #10.4.10.f
Duplicate property term needs to be checked. See TA 1.3 for different testing situations to cover. In addition, the case of multiple layers of inheritance needs to be taken into account.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.11
The developer can remove the based ACC when one exists.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.12
The developer can transfer the ownership of an ACC, ONLY when it is in WIP states and owned by him, to ONLY another developer. In that case the ownership of the associations (ASCC and BCC) are transferred as well.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.13
The developer can refactor an ASCCP to base ACC providing that the base ACC is in WIP state, owned by the developer and there is no association to the refactoring ASCCP within base ACC hierarchy neither there is an association to the refactoring ASCCP within the ACCs that have the base ACC within their hierarchy.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.14
The developer cannot refactor an ASCCP to base ACC if

##### Test Assertion #10.4.14.a
The base ACC is in Draft state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.14.b
The base ACC is in Candidate state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.14.c
The base ACC is in Published state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.14.d
The base ACC in Deleted
##### Test Assertion #10.4.14.e
The base ACC is owned by another developer regardless of the state

#### Test Assertion #10.4.15
The developer cannot refactor an ASCCP to base ACC if the latter already contains this ASCCP either directly on indirectly in its hierarchy. When the developer selects the base ACC, he should be able to validate the choice. This means that Score should display all ACCs that the developer should take some action. After the developer takes that actions, Score deletes the associations to the ASCCPs that are same as the refactoring ASCCP (duplicate ASCCPs) and moves the refactoring ASCCP to the selected base ACC. Check for:

##### Test Assertion #10.4.15.a
Moving an ACC to WIP state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.15.b
Take the ownership of an ACC and move it to WIP state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.15.c
which are not in WIP state and those not in WIP state that also contain the refactoring

#### Test Assertion #10.4.16
The developer cannot refactor an ASCCP to a selected base ACC if the ASCCP already exists as a property in a group ACC used in an association of under an ACC that exists in a hierarchy of the selected base ACC. In this case the developer should ungroup the group ACC so that he can refactor the ASCCP to the base ACC.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.17
The developer can cancel the revision of the Editing ACC. Doing so, Score restores the association to the refactored ASCPP.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.18
The developer can cancel the revision of the base ACC where an ASCCP was moved. Doing so, Score deletes the association to the ASCCP.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.19
The developer can cancel the revision of an ACC that had the base ACC as its based and also it had an association to the ASCCP that the developer refactored (this association was deleted because of the refactoring). Doing so, Score restores the association to the refactored ASCPP.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.20
The developer can refactor an BCCP to base ACC providing that the base ACC is in WIP state, owned by the developer and there is no association to the refactoring BCCP within base ACC hierarchy neither there is an association to the refactoring BCCP within the ACCs that have the base ACC within their hierarchy.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.21
The developer cannot refactor an BCCP to base ACC if

##### Test Assertion #10.4.21.a
The base ACC is in Draft state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.21.b
The base ACC is in Candidate state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.21.c
The base ACC is in Published state
##### Test Assertion #10.4.21.d
The base ACC in Deleted
##### Test Assertion #10.4.21.e
The base ACC is owned by another developer regardless of the state

#### Test Assertion #10.4.22
The developer cannot refactor an BCCP to base ACC if the latter already contains this BCCP either directly on indirectly in its hierarchy. When the developer selects the base ACC, he should be able to validate the choice. This means that Score should display all ACCs with some issues, namely the ACCs that contain the refactoring BCCP already of the base ACC that contain the BCCP. If the developer  refactors the BCCP to the selected base ACC, the BCCPs that exists in the hierarchy are deleted and the new BCCP is moved to the base ACC.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.23
The developer cannot refactor an BCCP to base ACC if the BCCP already exists as a property in a group ACC which exists under the base ACC.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.24
The developer can cancel the revision of the Editing ACC. Doing so, Score restores the association to the refactored BCCP.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.25
The developer can cancel the revision of the base ACC where an BCCP was moved. Doing so, Score deletes the association to the BCCP.

#### Test Assertion #10.4.26
The developer can cancel the revision of an ACC that had the base ACC as its based and also it had an association to the BCCP that the developer refactored (this association was deleted because of the refactoring). Doing so, Score restores the association to the refactored BCCP.

#### Test Assertion #10.7.10
The developer can change (move up or down) the sequence of the brand-new and existing association to a BCCP. It would be good to be able to drag-n-drop instead of moving up or down. Existing associations cannot be moved.

#### Test Assertion #10.7.11
The developer can remove an existing new association (ASCC or BCC) added in this revision (new association added during this revision should still have revision #1), there must be a confirmation dialog box though. However, an association cannot be removed if it is used as a replacement of a deprecated association. Information about the removed association is kept in the history record. The developer can also remove an association added to a previous revision. There should also be a confirmation dialog. If the developer cancel the revision, the removed associations should be restored.

#### Test Assertion #10.7.16
The developer can move an existing association (i.e., ASCCP, BCCP) of the revised ACC to its base ACC (including the base ACC of its base ACC as so fourth - For example if the revised ACC is based on ACC1 that is based on ACC2 that is based on ACC3, the developer the move the association to any of these ACCs). The base ACC has to be in WIP state while there must not be any BIE using the revised ACC or the base ACC.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 10.8

> Developer ACC state management

Pre-condition: The user is on the ACC detail page, which he owns.
All these state changes need a confirmation dialog box with slightly different messages.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #10.8.1
The developer can change the ACC state from WIP to Draft state. The system shall then change the state of its children associations that are also in the WIP state to the Draft state. There is no need to check the state of the dependencies (we will ensure that everything is consistently in the Candidate state at the release time). (Note that I change the rule about viewing details of CC in WIP state that the detail can be viewed by any user so the user should be able to expand the tree of the ACC).

## Test Case 10.9

> Deleting developer ACC

Pre-condition: N/A
Delete a CC means that it is marked as “Deleted” and it is still displayed in the CC list when the working branch is selected. If a CC is “Deleted” any other developer can restore it. Delete also means the deleted information is kept in the ACC table. Generally, when an entity is opened that has a relationship (whether in association or in base relationship) to a deleted entity, the opened entity shall be flagged as in an invalid state. And once the user has expanded the tree down to the deleted entity, the deleted entity should be flagged as deleted. This is applied to all test cases related to deletions.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #10.9.1
If an ACC revision number is 1, the developer owner can delete it when it is in WIP state. A confirmation dialog box should appear to ask for a confirmation.  After successful deletion, the system takes the user back to the CC list page. The deleted ACC shall appear in the working branch CC list (even without the Deleted state filter).

#### Test Assertion #10.9.2
Upon opening an ACC that has a descendant ACC that has a deleted ACC as a base, the system shall be able to flag that the opening ACC is in an invalid state and flag that the descendant-based ACC is in the deleted state. After the based ACC is replaced or restored, the developer should be able to see that reflected in the ACC tree (e.g., after clicking refresh).

#### Test Assertion #10.9.3
Upon opening an ACC that uses a deleted ACC as a base, the system should flag that the opening ACC is in an invalid state and the based ACC is in the deleted state. The system shall allow the developer to select a new ACC as a base or do away with the base. The system shall also allow the developer to open the deleted ACC to restore it. The developer shall be able to see that the based ACC is no longer in the deleted state after the restoration.

#### Test Assertion #10.9.4
Upon opening an ACC that has an association to an ASCCP that uses a deleted ACC, the system shall be able to flag that the opening ACC is in an invalid state and the other ACC as in the deleted state. After the deleted ACC is restored or replaced, the developer shall be able to see that reflected in the ACC he has opened earlier (e.g., after refreshing the detail page).

#### Test Assertion #10.9.5
Upon opening an ACC that has a descendant ACC that was deleted earlier, the system shall be able to flag that the opening ACC is in an invalid state and the descendant ACC as in the deleted state. After the deleted ACC is resurrected or replaced, the developer shall be able to see that reflected in the ACC he has opened earlier (e.g., after refreshing the ACC detail page).

#### Test Assertion #10.9.6
Upon opening an ASCCP that uses the deleted ACC, the ASCCP shall be highlighted or flagged somehow indicating that the ASCCP is an invalid state and that the ACC is in the deleted state. The system shall provide an option for the developer to choose another ACC. The system shall also allow the developer to open the deleted ACC in another tab where he can restore it. The developer may need to refresh the ASCCP detail page to clear the invalid flag.

#### Test Assertion #10.9.7
ACC whose revision number is more than 1 and is in any state cannot be deleted.

### Test Step Pre-condition:

## Test Case 10.12

> Editing a brand-new developer ASCCP

Pre-condition: The brand-new ASCCP is created by the developer and it is in the WIP state. The developer accesses these functionalities by opening the brand-new ASCCP from the CC list page or after creating a brand-new ASCCP according to Test Assertion #1 in Test Case 10.9.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #10.12.1
The developer can change the properties of the ASCCP and save the changes with the following business rules.

##### Test Assertion #10.12.1.a
The fields “Property Term”, “Reusable”, “Nillable”, “Definition”, “Definition Source”, and “Namespace” can be changed.
##### Test Assertion #10.12.1.b
Deprecated field is locked at the value false.
##### Test Assertion #10.12.1.c
The field “DEN” is automatically changed based on the changes of the “Property Term” field.

If Object Class Term of the ACC used by the ASCCP changes, DEN of the ASCCP shall get updated. (This can occur only when both the ASCCP and ACC have revision #1.)

#### Test Assertion #10.12.4
When the ASCCP DEN changes, all ASCCs which uses the ASCCP and whose revision numbers are 1 shall have their DEN updated accordingly. (Note: I think updating ASCC DENs when opening the ACC owning them may not be a good option because the system has to make sure that ASSC DENs in any descendant ACC have to also be updated as the user keeps expanding the tree).

#### Test Assertion #10.12.5
The developer can change the underlying ACC to a new one. Only ACC whose component type is Semantics or Semantics Group can be selected. At least test that Extension ACC cannot be tested.

#### Test Assertion #10.12.6
The developer can Exclude SCs or not from the Searching Field by checking or unchecking the “Exclude SCs” checkbox accordingly.

##### Test Assertion #10.12.6.a
If the “Exclude SCs” checkbox is enabled (i.e., checked) the SCs are excluding from the searching field
##### Test Assertion #10.12.6.b
If the “Exclude SCs” checkbox is disabled (i.e., unchecked) the SCs are excluding from the searching field
