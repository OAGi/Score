### Test Step:

## Test Case 15.4

> Amend an end user ACC

Pre-condition: The end user has selected a particular release branch.
Generally, only backwardly compatible changes can be made.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.4.1
On the CC Detail page of an end user ACC in Production state, the end user can amend the ACC. There should be a dialog asking the end user to confirm the intention to amend. [Note: In this case of amendment, the system simply advances the revision number, resets the revision tracking number to 1, and changes the state of the ACC back to WIP, i.e.,  detail of the previous revision of the ACC is not kept in the ACC table and it will not be possible to retrieve the whole structure of the previous revision of the ACC.]  Its attributes are initially the same as before the amendment.

#### Test Assertion #15.4.2
The end user cannot amend a released developer ACC.

#### Test Assertion #15.4.3
If ACC’s Component Type is User Extension Group, the end user cannot change/update any detail of the ACC.

#### Test Assertion #15.4.4
If ACC’s Component Type is NOT User Extension Group, the end user can change the details of the ACC and save the changes with the following business rules.

##### Test Assertion #15.4.4.a

##### Test Assertion #15.4.4.b
Abstract can only be changed from True to False, except when the Component Type is base where it should be locked as True.
##### Test Assertion #15.4.4.c
“Namespace” and “Object Class Term” cannot be changed.
##### Test Assertion #15.4.4.d
If the Deprecated was already True in the previous revision, the field along with the Replaced By field should be locked. If it was False in the previous revision the checkbox shall be enabled. When Deprecated is changed to True, the end user must be able to select a replacement ACC in the same release that is not already deprecated from a drop-down list or search dialog in the Replaced By field – but the field is optional. If the Deprecated is changed to False, the Replaced By field shall be Null and optionally disappears from the UI.
##### Test Assertion #15.4.4.e
Definition and Definition Source can be changed. However, a warning should be given when the Definition is empty.

#### Test Assertion #15.4.5
Place holder for testing about undoing changes to the ACC in the future or about displaying history during the amendment.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 15.5

> End user ACC state management

Pre-condition: The end user is on the ACC detail page, which he owns.
All these state changes need a confirmation dialog box with slightly different messages. Changing to the QA state only need a confirmation. Retracting a QA ACC to WIP needs a confirmation. Amending a Production ACC which set its state to WIP needs a confirmation.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.5.1
The end user can change the ACC state from WIP to QA. The system shall then change the state of its children associations that are also in the WIP state to the QA state. There is no need to check the state of the dependencies (we will ensure that everything is consistently in the Production state when a BIE Extension that has the end user CC is expanded). (Note that I change the rule about viewing details of CC in WIP state that the detail can be viewed by any user so the user should be able to expand the tree of the ACC).

#### Test Assertion #15.5.2
The end user can change the ACC state from QA back to WIP. State of the associations also go back to WIP.

#### Test Assertion #15.5.3
The end user can change the ACC state from QA to Production. State of the associations also go to Production.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 15.6

> Deleting an end user ACC

Pre-condition: N/A
Delete a CC means that it is marked as “Deleted” and it is still displayed in the CC list when the branch it belongs to is selected. If a CC is “Deleted” any other end user can restore it.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.6.1
If an ACC revision number is 1, the end user owner can delete it when it is in WIP state. A confirmation dialog box should appear to ask for a confirmation.  After successful deletion, the system takes the user back to the CC list page.

#### Test Assertion #15.6.2
Upon opening an ACC that has a descendant ACC that has a deleted ACC as a base, the system shall be able to flag that the descendant-based ACC is in deleted state. After the based ACC is replaced or resurrected, the end user should be able to see that reflected in the ACC tree (e.g., after clicking refresh).

#### Test Assertion #15.6.3
Upon opening an ACC that uses a deleted ACC as a base, the system should flag that the based ACC is in deleted state. The system shall allow the end user to select a new ACC in the same release as a base or do away with the base. The system shall also allow the end user to open the deleted end user ACC to restore it. Then, the end user shall be able to see in the ACC detail page that the based ACC is no longer in the deleted state, e.g., after refreshing the ACC detail page.

#### Test Assertion #15.6.4
Upon opening an ACC that has an association to an ASCCP that uses a deleted ACC, the system shall be able to flag that ACC as deleted. After the deleted ACC is resurrected or replaced, the end user shall be able to see that reflected in the ACC he has opened earlier, e.g., after refreshing the detail page.

#### Test Assertion #15.6.5
Upon opening an ACC that has a descendant ACC that was deleted earlier used in in one or more associations, the system shall be able to flag the deleted ACC on those associations (for example in many BODs the same ACC such as customer party is used in both the header and the line components). After the deleted ACC is resurrected or replaced, the end user shall be able to see that reflected in the ACC he has opened earlier, e.g., after refreshing the ACC detail page.

#### Test Assertion #15.6.6
Upon opening an ASCCP that uses the deleted ACC, the ASCCP shall be highlighted or flagged somehow indicating that the ASCCP is an invalid state. The system shall provide an option for the end user to choose another ACC, which can be an end user ACC or developer ACC. The system shall also allow the end user to open the deleted ACC in another tab where he can restore it. The end user may need to refresh the ASCCP detail page to clear the invalid flag.

#### Test Assertion #15.6.7
ACC whose revision number is more than 1 and is in any state cannot be deleted.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 15.7

> Restoring end user ACC

Pre-condition: The end user is on the CC View/Edit page with a release branch open. Deleted CCs are shown in the list.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.7.1
The end user can open an ACC and restore it. All of its associations shall be restored as well.

(maybe the ASCCP with the same property term should not appear in the list of the dialog used to append ASCCPs. Note that there may be multiple ASCCPs with the same property term even in the same release – this situation occurs with the Data Area ASCCP).
##### Test Assertion #15.8.1.d
The resulting ASCC shall be in the WIP state.
##### Test Assertion #15.8.1.e
If the ASCCP is not reusable, check that there is no ASCC already using it.

The default value of the new BCC shall be as follows: Min=0, Max = “unbounded”, Deprecated = false and disabled, Entity Type = Element, Value Constraint= None (Default and Fixed value should be empty), Definition = empty, Definition Source = empty.

##### Test Assertion #15.8.4.a
The selected BCCP can be in any state.
##### Test Assertion #15.8.4.b

##### Test Assertion #15.8.6.g
If the Entity Type is changed from Element to Attribute the Min Cardinality should be changed to 0 and the Max Cardinality to 1.
##### Test Assertion #15.8.6.h
The Entity Type can be changed to Attribute ONLY if the BCCP has no SC or all SCs have 0 max cardinality.

#### Test Assertion #15.8.7

## Test Case 15.10

> Creating a brand-new end user ASCCP

Pre-condition: N/A


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.10.1
The end user cannot create a brand-new ASCCP when the working branch is selected.

#### Test Assertion #15.10.2
On the CC list page where a release branch is selected, the end user can create a brand-new ASCCP by selecting an (developer or end user) ACC in the same release, in any state, and owned by any user. The ASCCP should have the following default values – Property Term = [ACC Object Class Term]; DEN = [Property Term] + [ACC Object Class Term] and locked; Reusable = true; Definition = blank; Definition_Source=blank; Deprecated = false and disable; Nillable = false; Namespace = null; Comments = empty. The brand-new ASCCP must have the selected release number assigned right away, i.e., it must not appear in any other release except the release the user has selected at the time of creation. It has a revision number of 1. The ASCCP should have the associated ACC along with its properties but they cannot be changed. Only ACC whose Component Type is Semantics or Semantic Group can be selected.

#### Test Assertion #15.10.3
If the underlying ACC has changed, particularly the Object Class Term of the ACC, after the ASCCP was first created, the system should automatically pick up the change, e.g., when the ASCCP is opened or refreshed on the ASCCP details page.

#### Test Assertion #15.10.4
The end user can create an ASCCP from an ACC in WIP state using the function “Create ASCCP from this”. The Property Term of the created ASCCP is based on the Object Class Term of the ACC.

##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.a
The fields “Property Term”, “Reusable”, “Definition”, “Definition Source”, “Namespace”, and “Nillable” can be changed.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.b
Deprecated field is locked at the value false.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.c
The field “DEN” is automatically changed based on the changes of the “Property Term” field and the “Object Class Term” of the ACC.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.d
A warning should be given when the Definition is empty.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.e
The fields “GUID” and “DEN” cannot be changed.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.f

Only non-standard namespace shall be allowed for the “Namespace”.
##### Test Assertion #15.11.1.i
“Property Term”, “Reusable”, “Namespace”, and “Nillable” are required. [Note that Namespace is required for ASCCP, so the User Extension Group ASCCP perhaps should have a namespace too.

Generally, only backwardly compatible changes can be made.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.12.1
On the CC Detail page of an end user ASCCP in Production state, the end user can amend the ASCCP. There should be a dialog asking the end user to confirm the intention to amend. [Note: In this case, the system simply advances the revision number, resets the revision tracking number to 1, and changes the state of the ASCCP back to WIP, i.e., there is no snapshot of the previous version kept in the ASCCP table.] Its attributes are initially the same as before the amendment.

#### Test Assertion #15.12.2

On the CC View/Edit page where a particular release branch is selected, the end user can create a brand-new BCCP by selecting a BDT which can be in any state and belongs to any user. The BDT choice shall, by default, be all BDT types and Commonly Used filter set to Empty-All. (see section 4.1.1.12.1 in the SRT Design Document version 2.4 to understand what is unqualified BDT), but the user has a choice to be able to select any BDT (type > 1). The BCCP should have the following default values – Property Term = “Property Term”; DEN = Property Term + “. “ + BDT_Data_Type_Term and locked; Nillable = false; Deprecated = false and disabled; Value Constraint= None (Default and Fixed value should be empty); Definition = blank; ; Definition Source = blank; Namespace = null, Comments = empty.

Pre-condition: N/A
Generally, only backwardly compatible changes can be made.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.16.1
On the CC Detail page of an end user BCCP in Production state, the end user even when he is not the owner can amend the BCCP. There should be a dialog asking the end user to confirm the intention to amend. [Note: In this case, the system simply advances the revision number, resets the revision tracking number to 1, and changes the state of the BCCP back to WIP.]  Its attributes are initially the same as before the amendment. [Note that I use the word ‘Amend’ as opposed to ‘Create a new Revision’ or ‘Revise’ as in the case of the developer CC, because in the case of the end user CC, the previous revision won’t be kept.]

#### Test Assertion #15.16.2
The end user cannot amend a released developer BCCP.

## Test Case 15.18

> Deleting an ender user BCCP

Pre-condition: N/A
Delete a CC means that it is marked as “Deleted” and it is still displayed in the CC list when the associated release branch is selected. If a CC is “Deleted” another end user can restore it. A confirmation dialog is needed for all deleting actions. “Do you really want to delete the core component?”


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #15.18.1
If a BCCP revision number is 1, the end user who is the owner of the BCCP can delete it when it is in WIP state. A confirmation dialog box should appear to ask for a confirmation.  After successful deletion, the system takes the user back to the CC list page.

#### Test Assertion #15.18.2
