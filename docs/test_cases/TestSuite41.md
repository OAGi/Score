### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.2.1
On the CC list page where a release branch is selected, the end user can create a brand-new DT after selecting a base DT. The new DT has the following default values – Based Data Type= [DEN of Base DT] and disabled, Data Type Term = [Data Type Term of Base DT] and disabled, Qualifier = [Qualifier of Base DT]; DEN = [Qualifier] + [Data Type Term] + “. Type” and disabled; Six Digit Identifier= blank; Namespace = null, Definition Source=blank, Definition=blank, Content Component Definition=blank, Comments = empty, Primitive=[Base DT Primitive], Primitive XML Expression=[ Base DT Primitive XML Expression]. The brand-new DT belong to a specific release, i.e., it must not appear in the working branch. It has a revision number 1. All fields are required and cannot be blank except Qualifier, Six Digit Identifier, Definition, Definition Source, Content Component Definition and Comments.

#### Test Assertion #41.2.2
The end user cannot create a brand-new end user DT when the working branch is selected.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 41.3

> Editing a brand-new end user DT

Pre-condition: The brand-new DT is created by the end user and is in the WIP state. The end user accesses these functionalities by opening the brand-new DT from the CC list page or after creating a brand-new DT according to the Test Case 39.1.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.3.1
The end user can change the properties of the DT and save changes with the following business rules.

##### Test Assertion #41.3.1.a
Namespace and Domain Value are required.  There should be a drop-down list for Namespace. A new value domain entry can be added, discarded, or Edited according to Test Case 41.8. Inherited domain value entry cannot be edited. Only Namespace that is a standard namespace shall be allowed.
##### Test Assertion #41.3.1.b
Qualifier can be updated such that it contains zero or more qualifiers in front of the qualifiers inherited from the based DT.
##### Test Assertion #41.3.1.c
Six digit identifier is optional.
##### Test Assertion #41.3.1.d
Content Component Definition, Definition and Definition Source are optional. However, A warning should be given when the Definition is empty.

#### Test Assertion #41.3.2
A new SC can be added to the DT and edited according to Test Case 41.4 and Test Case 41.5, respectively.

#### Test Assertion #41.3.3
SC inherited from based DT can only be edited according to Test Case 38.7.

#### Test Assertion #41.3.4
Once the Update button is clicked, the changes, except Definition and Definition Source and Content Component Definition, must also be made to all DTs derived from this DT (test for at least 2 levels of derivations). Note that any restriction put upon this DT in the derived DT would be lost. There should be a confirmation dialog indicating this when the Update button was clicked – “Restrictions applied in all DT derived from this DT will be lost”. Definition, Definition Source, and Content Component Definition shall be propagated only if they were the same before the change. In other word, if these fields have been altered in the derived DTs before the change in this DT, leave the one altered alone. Note the loss is associated with only restrictions, i.e., new value domain added in the derived DT should not be loss/overwritten. Note that the Namespace should not be propagated to the derived DTs.

Note that any restriction put upon this SC in the derived DT would be lost. There should be a confirmation dialog indicating this when the Update button was clicked – “Extensions and restrictions applied to this SC in all DT derived from this DT will be lost”.  Definition and Definition Source shall be propagated only if they were the same before the change. In other word, if the Definition and Definition Source have been altered in the derived DTs before the change in this DT, leave the one altered alone. Note the loss is associated with only restrictions, i.e., new value domain added in the derived DT should not be loss/overwritten.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 41.8

> Editing Value Domains

Pre-condition: The DT is in WIP state. This Test Case applies to value domain editing of both the DT content component and supplementary components, so each assertion needs to be tested for both the cases of content component and supplementary component.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.8.1
The user can add a value domain that whose value domain type is a Code List or Agency ID List only if there is already a value domain whose type is Primitive and the CDT Primitive is Token.

### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.9.1
On the CC Detail page of a release branch, the end user can create a new revision of an DT (i.e., amend) that is in Production state regardless of the current owner. The result is that this branch has that DT with an incremental revision number that is in the WIP state.  Its detail attributes are initially the same as those of the previous revision.

#### Test Assertion #41.9.2

#### Test Assertion #41.10.2
Once the Update button is clicked, all changes, except Definition, Definition Source, and Content Component Definition, shall be propagated to DTs derived from this DT. There should be a confirmation dialog indicating – “Restrictions applied to this SC in all DT derived from this DT will be lost”. Note the loss is associated with only restrictions, i.e., new value domain and SC added in the derived DT shouldn’t be lost. Once the Update button is clicked, the changes, except Definition and Definition Source, must also be made to all DTs derived from this DT (test for at least 2 levels of derivations). Note that any restriction put upon this DT in the derived DT would be lost. There should be a confirmation dialog indicating this when the Update button was clicked – “Restrictions applied in all DT derived from this DT will be lost”. Definition and Definition Source shall be propagated only if they were the same before the change. In other word, if these fields have been altered in the derived DTs before the change in this DT, leave the one altered alone.

Once the Update button is clicked, the changes, except Definition and Definition Source, must also be made to the corresponding SC in all DTs derived from this DT (test for at least 2 levels of derivations). Note that any restriction put upon this SC in the derived DT would be lost. There should be a confirmation dialog indicating this when the Update button was clicked – “Extensions and restrictions applied to this SC in all DT derived from this DT will be lost”.  Definition and Definition Source shall be propagated only if they were the same before the change.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 41.12

> End User DT state management

Pre-condition: The user is on the DT detail page, which he owns.
All these state changes need a confirmation dialog box with slightly different messages.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.12.1
The end user can change the DT state from WIP to QA state.

#### Test Assertion #41.12.2
The end user can change the DT state from QA to Production.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 41.13

> Deleting end user DT

Pre-condition: N/A
Delete a CC means that it is marked as “Deleted” and it is still displayed in the CC list when a non-working branch is selected. If a CC is “Deleted” any other end user can restore it. Delete also means the deleted information is kept in the DT table. Generally, when an entity is opened that has a relationship (whether in association or in base relationship) to a deleted entity, the opened entity shall be flagged as in an invalid state. And once the user has expanded the tree down to the deleted entity, the deleted entity should be flagged as deleted. This is applied to all test cases related to deletions.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #41.13.1
If an DT revision number is 1, the end user owner can delete it when it is in WIP state. A confirmation dialog box should appear to ask for a confirmation.  After successful deletion, the system takes the user back to the CC list page. The deleted DT shall appear in the non-working branch CC list (even without the Deleted state filter).

#### Test Assertion #41.13.2
Upon opening a DT that uses a deleted DT as a base, the system shall be able to flag that the opening DT is in an invalid state and flag that the descendant-based DT is in the deleted state. After the based DT is replaced or restored, the end user should be able to see that reflected in the DT tree (e.g., after clicking refresh).

#### Test Assertion #41.13.3
DT whose revision number is more than 1 and is in any state cannot be deleted.

### Test Step Pre-condition:



### Test Step:

## Test Case 41.14
