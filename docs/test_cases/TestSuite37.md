## Test Case 37.2

> Creating a brand-new end user Agency ID list

Pre-condition: A release branch is selected.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #37.2.1
On the Agency ID list View/Edit page where a release branch is selected, the end user can create a brand-new Agency ID list without base with only required information, See Create a Brand new Agency ID list in Score User Guide for Mandatory/Optional fields. The following are default values – Based Code List = Null (this field can be hidden in case of an Agency ID list without base) and cannot be changed; Name = “AgencyIdentification”; List ID = Randomly Generated GUID; Agency ID =blank ; Version = blank; Definition = blank; Deprecated = false (and locked); Namespace = null; Comments = empty. It must not appear in any other branch. It has a revision number 1.

#### Test Assertion #37.2.3
The end user can discard an Agency ID list value during the Agency ID list without base creation.

#### Test Assertion #37.2.4
The end user cannot create an Agency ID list without base, when it does not meet a uniqueness constraint (i.e., no other Agency ID list with same List ID, Agency ID and Version should exist in the selected branch). See Create a Brand New Agency ID List in Score User Guide for the uniqueness constraint.

### Test Step:

## Test Case 37.3

> Editing a brand-new end user Agency ID list

Pre-condition: The brand-new Agency ID list is created by the end user and is in the WIP state. The end user accesses these functionalities by opening the brand-new Agency ID list from the Agency ID list View/Edit page on a particular release branch or after creating a brand-new end user Agency ID list.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #37.3.1
The end user can change the properties of the Agency ID list and save changes with the following business rules.

##### Test Assertion #37.3.1.a
The List ID, Agency ID, and Version have to be unique in the branch.
##### Test Assertion #37.3.1.b
Based Agency ID list may be null or has a value but must be locked (because a based Agency ID list, if there is, would already be selected at this Agency ID list creation).
##### Test Assertion #37.3.1.c
Name, List ID, Agency ID, Version and Namespace are mandatory. Deprecated is also mandatory but must be false (and locked). Namespace must be a non-standard namespace.
##### Test Assertion #37.3.1.d

For an Agency ID list with base, the end user can discard derived Agency ID list values and save.

#### Test Assertion #37.3.4
For an Agency ID list with base, the end user can change existing Agency ID list values and their details.

#### Test Assertion #37.3.5
For new Agency ID list Value, only the Value and Meaning are required.

#### Test Assertion #37.3.6
A newly added Agency ID list Value can be discarded. Application shall check for any references before discarding it, e.g., when it is being referenced as a replacement of a deprecated value, or when it is referenced in code list (this likely shouldn’t happen b/c code list agency ID field also has a logic to prevent this).

#### Test Assertion #37.3.7
The end user can edit a newly added Agency ID list Value details except the Deprecated field with and without changing the Value field itself.

#### Test Assertion #37.3.8
In the Agency ID field, the end user can select a value from the Agency IDs in the current list.

##### Test Assertion #37.3.8.a
When a new Agency ID is added to the list, the end user must be able to use that ID in the Agency ID field.
##### Test Assertion #37.3.8.b
When the end user tries to discard an Agency ID in the list and it is used in the Agency ID field, the application must prevent that from happening. I.e., show a dialog box indicating that the Agency ID is used in the Agency ID field and cannot be deleted.

### Test Step:

## Test Case 37.4

> Amend an end user Agency ID list

Pre-condition: The end user has selected a particular release branch.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #37.4.1
On the Agency ID list Detail page of an end user Agency ID list in Production state, the end user can amend the Agency ID list regardless of the current owner. The result is that the release branch has that Agency ID list is in the WIP state and the revision number incremented by 1.  Its detail attributes are initially the same as those of the previous revision. All the Agency ID list Values from the previous revisions shall be present.

#### Test Assertion #37.4.2

#### Test Assertion #37.4.3
The end user can change the properties of the Agency ID list and save changes with the following business rules.

##### Test Assertion #37.4.3.a
If the Deprecated was already True in the previous revision, the field along with the Replaced By field should be locked. If it was False before the amendment the checkbox shall be enabled. When Deprecated is changed to True, the end user must be able to select a replacement Agency ID list that is not already deprecated from a drop-down list in the Replaced By field – but the field is optional. There can be only one replacement Agency ID list. When the Deprecated is changed to False, the Replaced By field shall be Null and optionally disappears from the UI.
##### Test Assertion #37.4.3.b
Based Agency ID list,  Namespace, Name, List ID, and Agency ID cannot be changed. The Version field is initially set to pre-amendment + “New” (same as developer code list), but the user can change to anything

Version, Definition, Definition Source and Remark can be changed.

#### Test Assertion #37.4.4
Existing Agency ID list Values from the previous revisions and that are not inherited from base cannot be removed and only their Meaning, and Definition field can be changed. If the Deprecated was already True in the previous revision, the field along with the Replaced By field should be locked. If Deprecated was false in the previous revision, the deprecated field can be changed from false to true. When it is changed to true, the end user can select ONE replacement Agency ID list value from the Agency ID list. When the Deprecated is changed to False, the Replaced By field shall be Null and optionally disappears from the UI.

#### Test Assertion #37.4.5
Agency ID list Values from the previous revisions and that are inherited from base cannot be removed and only their Meaning, and Definition field can be changed. If the Deprecated was already True in the previous revision, the field along with the Replaced By field should be locked. If Deprecated was false in the previous revision, the deprecated field can be changed from false to true. When it is changed to true, the end user can select ONE replacement Agency ID list value from the Agency ID list. When the Deprecated is changed to False, the Replaced By field shall be Null and optionally disappears from the UI.

#### Test Assertion #37.4.6

> Deleting an Agency ID list

Pre-condition: N/A
Delete an Agency ID list means that it is marked as “Deleted” and it is still displayed in the Agency ID list page (Core Component -> View/Edit Agency ID list) when the release branch the Agency ID list belongs to is selected. If an Agency ID list is “Deleted” any other end user can restore it.


### Test Assertion:

#### Test Assertion #37.6.1
If an end user Agency ID list revision number is 1, the end user owner can delete it when it is in WIP state and is owned by him. A confirmation dialog box should appear to ask for a confirmation.
