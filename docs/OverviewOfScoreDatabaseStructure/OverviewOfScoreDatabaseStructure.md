# Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a concise overview of Score database structure to assist in the contribution to Score development. As Score has adopted a canonical data model design based on [CCTS (Core Component Technical Specification) v3.0](https://unece.org/DAM/cefact/codesfortrade/CCTS/CCTS-Version3.pdf), core structural characteristics in tables and columns such as names and data types follow CCTS definitions.

# Core Components (CCs) and Business Information Entities (BIEs)
In general, CCTS defines two abstract meta models: Core Components (CCs) and Business Information Entities (BIEs). There are various types of CCs and also various types of BIEs.

The definition of each data element in a data exchange specification is represented as a CC, while a specialized definition of a CC in a particular business context is reflected through a BIE. The relationships between CCs and BIEs are illustrated in the figure below. For a little deeper overview of CCTS, please visit [Core Component in Brief section in Score User Guide](./user_guide/index.rst#core-component-management).
